misunderstood subject: that input would be in hex specifically
led to complex hex-specific operations incl. modulo, converting to array indices...over-engineered

iterative solution: mirrors natural reading & processing of numbers, left > right, building up value position by position

look-up table, char[] to access new digit
	> get_digit function converts individual chars

process str, end > front
	> positional weights naturally build when processing left > right
