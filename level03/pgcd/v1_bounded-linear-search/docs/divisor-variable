originally when I declared it & assigned the smaller int to it, I called it beginning_int / similar

but through the life of this algo, it represents 3 things:
	Initially: the smaller of our two numbers (so starting pt of search)
	During search: the current potential divisor we're testing
	When found: our highest common divisor

More general name "divisor" maintains its mathematical meaning at each stage:
it's always a number we're considering in terms of its divisibility properties
