what it means for a number to be a power of 2 mathematically:

Powers of 2 form a sequence: 2⁰ = 1, 2¹ = 2, 2² = 4, 2³ = 8, 2⁴ = 16...

The pattern:
	Each number in this sequence is the previous number multiplied by 2
	Going backwards: each power of 2, when repeatedly divided by 2, will eventually reach exactly 1
	Any number that isn't a power of 2 will hit an odd number other than 1 when repeatedly divided by 2

The recursive essence becomes clear:
	Base case: If we reach 1, it was a power of 2
	Base case: If we reach an odd number other than 1, it wasn't a power of 2
	Recursive step: Keep dividing by 2 until we hit a base case




Any number n can be divided by 2 repeatedly until you hit:
	Either 1 (success case - it was a power of 2)
	Or some odd number > 1 (failure case - it wasn't a power of 2)



This is mathematically guaranteed because:
	Powers of 2 will divide down cleanly: 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
	Non-powers of 2 will eventually hit an odd factor: 12 → 6 → 3 (odd, stop!)



This pattern relates to several fundamental mathematical concepts:

Prime Factorization - specifically the process of repeatedly dividing by 2 is revealing the power of 2 in a number's prime factorization

Binary Numbers - there's a deep connection here because powers of 2 have exactly one '1' bit in their binary representation

In recursive algorithm design, this is a form of "decrease and conquer" strategy - where we keep reducing the problem size (by dividing by 2) until we hit fundamental base cases



In number theory, this process of repeatedly dividing by 2 until reaching an odd number is sometimes called "2-adic valuation" or "2-adic order" - it tells us the highest power of 2 that divides a number.

This kind of recursive pattern that decomposes a number into its prime power components is fundamental in multiplicative number theory. When we restrict it to just powers of 2, we're essentially checking if the 2-adic valuation gives us a "pure" power of 2.
