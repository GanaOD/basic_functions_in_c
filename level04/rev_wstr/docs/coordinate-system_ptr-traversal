Backward traversal of string 

ptr_lead--


coordinate systems and direction of traversal

In memory/string space, there's a natural coordinate system where addresses increase from start to end (positive direction). 

But ptr_lead's traversal is in the negative direction relative to this underlying space.



like a number line:

Memory addresses increasing →
     0   1   2   3   4   5
     h   e   l   l   o   \0
     ←   ←   ←   ←   ← 
     ptr_lead's movement


similar to how in physics/math we might have:
	A fixed coordinate system (memory addresses)
	An object moving in the negative direction relative to those coordinates
	But from the object's perspective, it's moving "forward" in its own reference frame
