Inclusive / exclusive?

Significance for 
	loop conditions
	index / ptr arithmetic
	edge case handling

In my final implementation: used both inclusive (char > char) & exclusive (spaces as boundaries)




I liked the idea of reducing state management by:
treating a word as being strictly bounded by:
	Beginning pointer points to first char
	End pointer points to last char

would mean;
	When scanning backwards, stop at first char of word (not the space before)
	Calculate length as: (end - start + 1)
	Handle spaces separately and uniformly
