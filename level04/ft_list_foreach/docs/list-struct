typedef	struct s_list
{
	struct s_list	*next;
	void					*data; // ptr to any type of data
}	t_list;


next:
self-referential structure - the struct contains a pointer to another instance of itself
this makes the "chain" possible

[Node A]         [Node B]         [Node C]
struct s_list    struct s_list    struct s_list
+----------+     +----------+     +----------+
|next: ----+---->|next: ----+---->|next: NULL|
|data: 0   |     |data: 3   |     |data: 4   |
+----------+     +----------+     +----------+

Each node's next points to another complete s_list structure. It can do this because even though we're still defining the structure, C allows us to declare a pointer to that same structure type we're defining

next doesn't store the entire next node - it just stores the memory address where the next node lives. This is why we can have a structure that "contains itself" - we're not really containing the whole structure, just an address pointing to another one!


different from e.g.:

struct s_list {
    struct s_list next;   // ERROR: Can't contain itself directly!
    void *data;
};

Which would try to contain the whole structure inside itself (infinite recursion)
