Was counter-intuitive to me: [y,x] where I'm used to using (x, y) in mathematics

Same here as in corrdinates of Excel spreadsheet

in array access we go [y][x] because:
	First we select which row (y coordinate)
	Then we select which column in that row (x coordinate)


Why?
The row-first [y][x] convention comes from how computer memory is organized linearly. 
Arrays in memory are stored row by row:
Memory layout:
[Row0Col0][Row0Col1][Row0Col2] | [Row1Col0][Row1Col1][Row1Col2]

So when I access tab[1][2], the computer:
	First jumps to row 1 (which it can do quickly because rows are stored sequentially)
	Then moves 2 positions right in that row

This was efficient for early computers that accessed memory sequentially.

Meanwhile, the (x,y) coordinate convention comes from mathematics/Cartesian coordinates, where:
	x traditionally represents horizontal movement (left/right)
	y represents vertical movement (up/down)
