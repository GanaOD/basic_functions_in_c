the role of current:
t_list *current = *begin_list;

a couple of critical purposes:

1. Creates a local reference to the current node before I potentially modify where begin_list points to. 

This is essential because:
	might need to free this node
	Once freed, can't access its next pointer
	If not stored, would lose access to both the node and what comes after it


2. Enables proper list relinking:

need to preserve node relationships when removing elements

current lets me bridge the gap when removing a node:

Before: A -> B -> C
current = B
After:  A -> C


3. Preserves recursive state:

Each recursive call needs its own reference to "its" node
current provides this local state at each level of recursion
