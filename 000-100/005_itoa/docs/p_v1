What's the cleanest way to handle number-to-string conversion while ensuring proper character ordering?

Before diving into recursion:
	what operation gives each digit from right to left? 
	How about from left to right? 
	Which would be more efficient for building string?

Related to memory management:
	For malloc, what determines the exact size needed? 
	what information I need to calculate this before starting the conversion

Attention to 42's expectations:
	what edge case might need handling that wasn't explicitly mentioned in the requirements, but would be important for robustness?




I wish to get digits from left > right to correspond with writing chars > string

Insight:
When you divide by the highest power of 10, the quotient gives the leftmost digit


How to determine the highest power of 10 for any given number? 
Could this calulation be related to goal of calculating the string length?


For getting the string length, could count recursions. 
Recursion gives digits in reverse order (2,3,4). 
To get them in correct order (4,3,2), need to either:
	Store and reverse them, or
	Find a way to process from left to right using powers of 10 as you mentioned


For v1:
iteration then conversion

Plan:
Iterate to count digits
Malloc with this length + 1
Fill string from right to left using modulo


Non-elegant approach but understandable
