After mallocing space for new string (the first word to be stored in program)

Copying operation: copying the first word from main string to this

Wrong: originally tried using condition:
while (*this_newly_malloced_string)
{
  copying
} 

Forgot that this is unitialised memory. The string will end up being the same length as the word, and this is the amount of memory that was malloced, but I need to consider more carefully the conditions I set for operations. In this case: incrementing within the bounds of a string (up to before its null determiner): only possible with an actual string 

Key Principle:
- Only read from initialized memory
- Use source string to control iteration
- Destination memory is just space until I write to it
