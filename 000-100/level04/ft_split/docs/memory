this line is interesting:
*ptr_write++ = *ptr_trail++;

we first assign the dereferenced value of ptr_trail to the dereferenced pointer > char of ptr_write
then we have a post-increment operator, whose standalone syntax would be
ptr_write++
ptr_trail++
idiom


Yes! This line packs a lot of C idioms into a concise operation. Let's break it down:

c

Copy
*ptr_write++ = *ptr_trail++;
The operation sequence is:

*ptr_trail - dereference to get the char
*ptr_write - dereference destination to prepare for writing
Assignment happens
Both pointers increment (post-increment means after the assignment)
This is classic idiomatic C string/memory manipulation - frequently seen in functions like strcpy. It's taking advantage of:

Pointer arithmetic
Post-increment evaluation order
Dereferencing
Value assignment
It's more concise than the equivalent:

c

Copy
*ptr_write = *ptr_trail;
ptr_write++;
ptr_trail++;
From a security perspective, this idiom needs careful bounds checking because it's so efficient that it can quickly write beyond buffer limits if not properly constrained.

"so efficient that it can quickly write"
something about this is interesting...like our program has different speeds of doing things, different forms of notation translate to different operations...consequences...


Yes, you're touching on something fundamental about computer systems! There's a fascinating connection between notation, machine operations, and real-world consequences.

Different C notations can translate to different assembly instructions and memory access patterns. For example:

c

Copy
// This idiomatic version:
*ptr_write++ = *ptr_trail++;

// Versus the more verbose:
*ptr_write = *ptr_trail;
ptr_write++;
ptr_trail++;
The idiomatic version often compiles to fewer instructions, potentially allowing for:

Pipeline optimizations
Fewer memory loads/stores
More efficient register usage
This efficiency means we can copy memory very quickly - which is powerful but dangerous. A classic example is buffer overflow attacks: the speed of memory operations means a program can corrupt critical memory before any checks kick in.

This gets deeper into computer architecture:

Memory operations happen at different speeds (registers vs cache vs RAM)
Pipeline optimization affects real execution time
Compiler optimizations can radically change how our code actually runs
This is why certain attacks (like timing attacks in cryptography) are possible - there are real, measurable time differences between different operations at the hardware level.
