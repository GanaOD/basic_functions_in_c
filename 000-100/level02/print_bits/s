Write a function that takes a byte, and prints it in binary WITHOUT A NEWLINE
AT THE END.

Your function must be declared as follows:

void	print_bits(unsigned char octet);

Example, if you pass 2 to print_bits, it will print "00000010"


while (i >= 0)
	{
		bits[i] = (n % 2) + '0';
		n = n / 2;
		i--;
	}
	write(1, bits, 8);
