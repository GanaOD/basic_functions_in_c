basic main function: want to print result to stdout

no built-in function that will automatically iterate and print an array of integers

insights:
	
	Arrays in C don't carry their length information with them
	
	Unlike strings (which are terminated by '\0'), there's no standard delimiter for integer arrays

	The system needs to know both:
		Where to start in memory ( pointer)
		How many integers to print ( length)



passed len by pointer 


then ditched this main
