Each node in the list is a struct
That struct has a member called 'next'
So when we say begin_list->next, we're accessing the 'next' member of the node that begin_list currently points to
even more explicit:
	We're at the current node (pointed to by begin_list)
	This current node contains a 'next' pointer
	We follow that pointer to reach the next node

The movement is always based on information in our current node.
