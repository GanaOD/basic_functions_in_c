PROBLEM
During train-of-thought implementation, put fizzbuzz portion after fizz & buzz

INSIGHT
If I have multiple conditions where one is more specific and encompasses other conditions,
check the most specific one first
otherwise logical short-circuiting (final condition never reached)

fizzbuzz:
A number divisible by both 3 AND 5 is a more specific condition
a subset of "divisible by 3" and "divisible by 5"
