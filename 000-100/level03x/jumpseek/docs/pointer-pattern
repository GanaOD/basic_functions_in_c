*(s2 + 1)

different than peeking-ahead i've used to date: 
here i'm doing a safety look-ahead (ensuring space exists)
	before striding ahead / taking off by 2
	doesn't analyse the actual "landing spot" 
where before i've used a content look-ahead:
	looking at actual next character(s) to make decisions
