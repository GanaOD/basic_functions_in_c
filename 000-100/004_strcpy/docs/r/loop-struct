# Why s2 the control condition?

What are we fundamentally doing?
	Mapping a sequence S2 to a sequence S1
	The sequence is defined by characters up to and including '\0'


# on incrementing order:

This is about dependency chain in the operation
Does copying s2[n] depend on having copied s2[n-1]? No
Therefore the increment order is not mathematically significant
However, CPU cache behavior might prefer sequential access patterns
