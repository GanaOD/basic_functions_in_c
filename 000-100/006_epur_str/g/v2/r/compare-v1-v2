different logical structure:
v1:
Instead of separating first word + subsequent words
	tracks "should I print a space before this character?" throughout the entire string


key difference:
	v1: Thinks in terms of "words" as complete units
	v2: Thinks in terms of individual characters and their transitions


Both are valid approaches. 
The flag version might be considered more "stateful" but it has the advantage of being more linear in its processing - 
it makes a single pass through the string making local decisions at each character.
