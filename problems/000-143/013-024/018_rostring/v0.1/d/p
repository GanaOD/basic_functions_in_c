1 pass through str

first word stored 
subsequent words directly displayed
then stored word displayed


SPACE MANAGING

is_space checks for all types of spaces 
	"Words will be separated by only one space in the output."
			IN THE OUPUT. I misread this at 1st glance!

after writing every word (before writing the stored one)
write a space
	this in a while loop

then outside loop, write stored word, not followed by space
