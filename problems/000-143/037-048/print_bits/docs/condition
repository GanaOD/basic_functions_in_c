instead of: while (position >= 0)

I originally had: while (position <= 15)

concrete problem:

	Moving AWAY from 15 (down)
  but checking if we're still BELOW 15!

	loop's movement (decreasing) and its termination check (<=) 
	were working against each other - was moving away from termination value forever

	(prog would crash when trying to access bits[-1])



general insight:


When designing a loop or recursive process, we need to think about:

	Termination condition ("base case")

What's our endpoint?
When should we stop?
In our case: when we've filled the last (leftmost) position (0)


	Progress toward that condition

How do we move toward our endpoint?
Is each iteration getting us closer?
In our case: position-- moves us toward 0


	Direction of movement

Are we counting up or down?
If counting down, stop at >= some number
If counting up, stop at <= some number



principle:
when designing any iterative or recursive process, 
ensure you're moving TOWARD your termination condition, not away from it.
