Lookup tables vs direct computation:
Lookup tables are better when:

Computation is expensive (many operations)
Input range is small and fixed
Speed is critical
Same values needed repeatedly

For example: sin(x) in graphics engines often uses lookup tables because:

Trigonometric computation is expensive
Angles often fall in predictable ranges (0-360Â°)
Games need it fast, many times per frame

But here:

Computation is just simple subtraction (c - '0' or c - 'a' + 10)
Logic is clear and maintainable
Memory tradeoff isn't worth it for such simple operations
