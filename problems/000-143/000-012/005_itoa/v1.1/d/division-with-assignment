/= is a compound assignment operator in C 
(and many other languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.). 
It performs division and assignment in a single operation.

In general computational terms, this is called "compound assignment" 
or "augmented assignment." 
It's syntactic sugar that combines an arithmetic operation with an assignment. 

These operators are designed to make code more concise and potentially more efficient, 
as the variable is only accessed once.


Other examples in the same family include:
	+= for addition and assignment
	-= for subtraction and assignment
	*= for multiplication and assignment
	%= for modulo and assignment
