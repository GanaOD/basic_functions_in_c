# logical flow

I will move from left to right

natural alignment with how we typically think about the set of integers and prime numbers.



# general idea, considerations

For checking primes, will need to:

	Iterate from 2 up to the input number
	For each number, check if it's prime
	If prime, add it to running sum



For prime verification, consider how to efficiently determine if a number is prime. 
Remember that a prime is only divisible by 1 and itself. 
There are several optimization opportunities here.


make sure to handle:

	Input validation (ensuring all characters are digits)
	Edge cases (non-positive numbers)
	Displaying "0" when needed (as per the problem requirements)
