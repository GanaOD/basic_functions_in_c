while (1) means "loop forever" because 1 is always true in C. It's an infinite loop that will only stop when we hit a return statement inside it



alternative equivalent ways to write an infinite loop in C:

while (true)   // if <stdbool.h> is included
for (;;)       // empty for loop
do {} while(1) // do-while version


for (;;) is particularly idiomatic in C - it's commonly used because:

It's visually distinctive
Clearly shows intent for an infinite loop
The empty initialization, condition, and increment sections (;;) make it obvious there's no planned exit condition except from within
