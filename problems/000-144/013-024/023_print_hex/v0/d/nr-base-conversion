problem is about number base conversion: decimal (base 10) â†’ hexadecimal (base 16)

This conversion follows a mathematical pattern: successive division by the new base

The algorithm for base conversion is:

While number > 0:
	Calculate remainder when dividing by target base
	Convert remainder to appropriate symbol (0-9, a-f for hex)
	Divide number by target base
	Add symbol to result (in reverse order)



This pattern reveals the essence of positional number systems - each position represents a power of the base, and the symbols used are just representations of quantities.
