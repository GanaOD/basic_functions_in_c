pattern perspective: this problem is about partitioning a sequence and 
rotating the first partition to the end. 


if we have a sequence S = {w₁, w₂, ..., wₙ}, 
the operation transforms it to S' = {w₂, w₃, ..., wₙ, w₁}, 
where each wᵢ is a "word" (contiguous non-whitespace characters).


The algorithm requires distinguishing between three key states:

	Whitespace (to be skipped or compressed)
	The first word (to be stored and moved)
	Subsequent words (to be output immediately)



From a state machine perspective, code will transition between:

	Skipping leading whitespace
	Processing the first word
	Skipping inter-word whitespace
	Processing subsequent words



The branching approach with sub-loops maps cleanly to these distinct states. 
Each branch handles a specific part of the transformation with its own termination condition.


In pseudocode:
	1. Skip leading whitespace
	2. Store first word
	3. Skip whitespace
	4. For each subsequent word:
		a. Print word
		b. If more words exist, print a single space
		c. Skip whitespace
	5. Print first word

This "chunking" approach is clean because it operates on meaningful units 
(words and spaces) rather than individual characters, 
keeping the logic at the appropriate level of abstraction.







State Machine Pattern: 
Your solution follows a clear state machine approach, transitioning between different states 
(leading spaces, first word, inter-word spaces, subsequent words) with each state having its own processing logic.

Special Case Handling with Rotation: 
You've implemented a pattern that handles the special case (first word) separately 
from the general case (remaining words), which aligns with the rotation operation required.

Peek-Ahead Pattern: 
You've used a temporary pointer to look ahead without disrupting the main pointer's traversal. 
This is a common pattern in parsing and text processing - 
checking future conditions without altering current state.

Buffer-Store-Display Pattern:
 You store the first word in a buffer while immediately processing the rest of the input, 
 then display the buffer at the end - a classic implementation of the rotation operation.



The nested logic represents a "lookahead decision pattern," where I:

	 process the current state (a word)
	 look ahead to future states (checking for more words)
	 make a decision based on that future state (whether to print a space)


This pattern allows me to make formatting decisions 
based on content that hasn't yet been fully processed.




The overall architecture follows a "process-special-case-first, then-general-logic" 
pattern which is foundational in many algorithms, especially those dealing with 
sequential data that needs transformation.
