if (!*s2)
{
	write (1, "0", 1);
	return;
}


I originally typed:

if (!*s2)
	write (1, "0", 1), return;



COMPILATION ERROR: expected expression

the comma operator does allow the sequencing of operations
but the return statement must be a separate statement in the control flow:
	it is not an expression - it's a control flow statement
	the comma operator works with expressions, not statements


Lack of theory, knowledge: what are expressions and statements?


# Systematic breakdown:

## Mathematical and Logical Foundations

**Expressions**
Mathematical/logical constructs that evaluate to a value

Examples: 2 + 2, x > y, f(x)

Key property: They can be reduced/evaluated to a single value
In type theory: They have a type and a value


**Statements:** 
Declarations of what should happen

No evaluation to a value
Instead, they affect the state of computation
More abstract than expressions




## Computer Science Implementation


Program execution is fundamentally about:

Control flow: The path of execution through code
State changes: Modifications to memory/registers


Control Flow Statements

	return: Transfers control back to caller
	break: Exits current loop/switch
	goto: Direct jump to label
	if/else: Conditional branching
	These manipulate the instruction pointer


Expressions in CS

Must be deterministically evaluable
Can be composed (like mathematical functions)
Have defined precedence rules
Example: (a + b) * c




## C Language Implementation

## my specific error:

write(1, "0", 1), return;

The comma operator attempts to compose:

write(1, "0", 1) (an expression)
return (a control flow statement)


This is fundamentally impossible because control flow statements operate on a different semantic level than expressions - they manipulate the program's execution path rather than computing values.

This ties directly to the assembly level:
	Expressions compile to sequences of computational instructions (ADD, MUL, etc.)
	Control flow statements compile to jump instructions (JMP, RET, etc.)
