I originally declared s2_scout as char * & casted s2 > char *

from safety & design perspective, declaring const char *s2_scout better:

type safety
	casting away const with s2 weakens the compiler's ability to catch potential errors

intent signaling
	using const char * clearly communicates that this is just a scout/cursor for reading 
	- we won't modify the original string

security
	Casting away const could theoretically allow code changes that modify the 
	original string. While not doing this here, it's good practice to maintain 
	const-correctness when possible.
