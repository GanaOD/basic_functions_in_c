Assignment: ft_split_mod
Turn in files: ft_split_mod.c
Allowed functions: malloc

Write a function that takes a string and a delimiter character, splits the string into segments, and returns them as a NULL-terminated array of strings.

A "segment" is defined as a part of a string delimited by the specified delimiter character, or by the start/end of the string.

Your function must be declared as follows:
char **ft_split_mod(char *str, char delim);


Examples:
Input: str = "apple,banana,orange", delim = ','
Return: ["apple", "banana", "orange", NULL]

Input: str = "hello", delim = 'x' 
Return: ["hello", NULL]

Input: str = ",test,,split,", delim = ','
Return: ["", "test", "", "split", "", NULL]


The words must be extracted as if they were delimited by a single character. 

The function returns NULL if allocation fails.
