Comparison with ft_list_remove_if: 
struct uses void *data âˆ´ a generic linked list - it can store pointers to any data type. 

This is more flexible but requires:
	Type casting when accessing the data
	A comparison function (cmp) to check equality since we don't know the data type


In ft_list_remove_out_of_range, the struct uses int data which means:
	It's specifically for storing integers (not pointers to integers)
	We can directly compare values without type casting
	No comparison function needed since we know we're working with integers
