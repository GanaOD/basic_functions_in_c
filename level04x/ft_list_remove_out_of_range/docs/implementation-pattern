Relinking: no need to to separately track the previous node or do any extra pointer manipulation. 
The recursion naturally gives us access to the exact pointer we need to modify.

(*begin_list)->next 		gets the next node's address from our node to remove
*begin_list = 					assigns this address to the previous node's "next" pointer
begin_list 							is a pointer to the previous node's "next" pointer


not working with the next node's "next" pointer - working with the previous node's "next" pointer, 
which I have direct access to due to recursive strategy of passing &((*begin_list)->next).



the elegance of the solution emerges from how it maps to fundamental abstract patterns:


Structural Recursion and Induction
	We're exploiting the recursive nature of linked lists - each node is a microcosm of the whole list
	The unwinding phase maps beautifully to mathematical induction: solving from the base case back


Pointer Indirection as Graph Transformation
	At a higher level, we're not just manipulating memory - we're transforming a directed graph
	The double pointer (t_list **) gives us the power to modify the graph's edges (links) directly
	When we write *begin_list = (*begin_list)->next, we're redirecting edges in this graph


Conservation of Information
	The solution preserves all necessary information at each step without additional storage
	The recursion stack implicitly maintains the path back
	The double pointer gives us exact access to the link we need to modify


Temporal vs. Spatial
	Rather than storing state in space (extra variables), we use the temporal nature of recursion
	The unwinding phase creates a natural "time machine" giving us access to both past and future nodes
