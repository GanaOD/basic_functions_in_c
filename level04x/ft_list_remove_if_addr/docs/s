Expected file: ft_list_remove_if_addr.c
Allowed functions: free

Write a function called ft_list_remove_if_addr that removes from the passed list any element whose address matches the reference address.

This differs from ft_list_remove_if in that it compares memory addresses directly instead of using a comparison function.


It will be declared as follows:

void ft_list_remove_if_addr(t_list **list_head, void *addr_ref);


Make use of:

typedef struct      s_list
{
    struct s_list   *next;
    void            *data;
}                   t_list;


This variation:
	Removes the comparison function parameter
	Compares addresses directly instead of data content
	Still needs to handle the same memory management and list relinking
	Should still work recursively
