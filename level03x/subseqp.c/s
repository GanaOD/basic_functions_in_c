Based off hiddenp

Expected files: subseqp.c
Allowed functions: write, malloc, free

Write a program named subseqp that takes three strings and displays 1 followed by a newline if the first string is hidden as multiple non-overlapping subsequences within the second string, and if the sum of the lengths of these subsequences is equal to the third parameter (which will be a positive number provided as a string). Otherwise, it displays 0 followed by a newline.
Let s1 and s2 be strings. A character from s2 can only be used once. The empty string is considered to have length 0.
If the number of parameters is not 3, or if the third parameter is not a valid positive number, the program displays a newline.


Examples:
$>./subseqp "aaaa" "baaabaa" "4" | cat -e
1$
$>./subseqp "aaa" "baaabaa" "3" | cat -e
1$
$>./subseqp "aaa" "baaabaa" "2" | cat -e
0$
$>./subseqp "abc" "btarc" "3" | cat -e
0$
$>./subseqp "abc" "btarctabc" "6" | cat -e
1$
$>./subseqp | cat -e
