/*
PLAN
to check for duplicates, need to remember which chars have been seen
Hence a buffer that serves as "memory", into which each unique char encountered gets stored

This allows function to:
	Track what's been seen in a single pass through each string
	Avoid nested loops through previous characters
	Maintain order of appearance from command line

gives O(n) scanning 
instead of O(nÂ²) that would come from checking each char against all previous chars in the strings
