At its core, this is about:

Input validation
Prime number identification
Summation
Output formatting

The mathematical essence involves number theory - 
specifically the definition of primes: numbers divisible only by 1 and themselves


# Formal Problem Description

Given a positive integer n, compute Σp where p is prime and p ≤ n.



# Implementation Approach
sketch the logical structure:

Validate command-line arguments: exactly 1 argument that's a positive integer

For each number from 2 to n:

	Determine if it's prime
	If prime, add to running sum

Display the final sum
