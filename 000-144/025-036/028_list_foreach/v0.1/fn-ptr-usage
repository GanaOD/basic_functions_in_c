In C, function pointers have specific syntax rules for both declaration and usage:


Your incorrect syntax: *f(begin_list->data)

This is parsed as *(f(begin_list->data)) due to operator precedence
This means "call function f with argument begin_list->data, then dereference the result"
But f is not a function - it's a pointer to a function



Correct syntax: (*f)(begin_list->data)

This means "dereference the function pointer f, then call that function with argument begin_list->data"
The parentheses around *f are necessary because function call operator () has higher precedence than dereference operator *



Alternative correct syntax: f(begin_list->data)

In C, a function pointer can be called directly with this simpler syntax
The language automatically dereferences the function pointer when used in a call context




Think of it this way:

f is the address of a function
*f is the function itself
To call the function, you need (*f)(args) or f(args)



Your original code was trying to dereference the return value of the function call, not the function pointer itself.
