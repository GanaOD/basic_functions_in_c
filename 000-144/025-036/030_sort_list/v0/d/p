Compared with 029:

high-level structure remains conceptually similar:

	Maintain a sorted portion (from beginning)
	Take each unsorted element and insert it in the correct position


The key differences will be:

	Traversal (next pointers instead of indexes)
	Element shifting (pointer reassignment instead of value copying)



For the linked list version:

	We'll need a pointer to the "current" node (equivalent to i)
	We'll need to handle the logic of removing a node and reinserting it
	The comparison will use the function pointer cmp instead of direct comparison


The tricky part with linked lists is that removing and inserting requires managing multiple pointers. 
We'll need to keep track of:

	The node being considered for insertion
	The previous node (to adjust pointers when removing)
	Where to insert it in the sorted portion



understanding the essence of insertion sort as applied to a linked list, focusing on the mathematical structure first.
First, let's clarify what we're working with. This is a linked list sorting problem using a comparison function pointer to determine order. The linked list structure will be defined in "list.h".
The essence of insertion sort on a linked list is different from an array because:

We don't have random access to elements
Node rearrangement requires pointer manipulation instead of value swapping

Let's think about what the t_list structure likely contains:

A data field (int, based on the comparison function)
A next pointer to the next node

For insertion sort on a linked list, consider these key operations:

Iterate through the list
For each node, find its correct position in the already-sorted portion
Remove the node from its current position
Insert it into its correct position

The algorithm complexity is different from array insertion sort because:

Finding insertion position requires traversing from the head
Pointer manipulation is O(1) once positions are found
