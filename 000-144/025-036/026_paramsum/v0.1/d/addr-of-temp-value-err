# PROBLEMO

I originally tried calculating char result directly within the address operator (in write call): write(1, &((i % 10) + '0'), 1)
COMPILER ERROR

# EXPLANATION

the compiler interpreted it as trying to take the address of a temporary value (the result of the expression (i % 10) + '0'). 
You can't take the address of a temporary expression result because it doesn't have a stable memory location. 
By storing it in a char variable first, you give it a proper memory location that can be referenced with &.
