I originally began main with:

if (!av)
		return (1);


redundant. The C standard guarantees that when a program starts, 
av is always a valid pointer to an array of strings (even if empty), 
so it will never be NULL in a standard-conforming implementation




(void)av

a compiler-related convention, not really a computational principle. 
It's about explicitly communicating intent to both the compiler and other programmers.


From a technical standpoint:

	When you declare a parameter in a function but don't use it, 
	most modern compilers will generate a warning (e.g., -Wunused-parameter in GCC/Clang)

	Casting the parameter to void creates an expression that has no effect (it evaluates the expression but discards the result)

	This satisfies the compiler that you've "used" the parameter, silencing the warning



This technique is valuable because:

	It distinguishes between accidentally unused parameters (bugs) and intentionally unused parameters (design choice)

	It maintains the function signature required by an interface or standard while clearly indicating which parts you're not using

	It improves code readability by explicitly documenting that ignoring the parameter is intentional



It's a small example of the broader principle that good code communicates intent, not just instructions. 
The compiler doesn't need the cast for correctness - it's purely informational.
