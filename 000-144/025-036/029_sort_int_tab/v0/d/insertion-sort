 mentally divide the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. 
take one element at a time from the unsorted portion and insert it into its correct position in the sorted portion


void sort_int_tab(int *tab, unsigned int size)
{
    int i = 1;
    int j;
    int current_value;
    
    while (i < size)
    {
        current_value = tab[i];
        j = i;
        
        while (j > 0 && tab[j - 1] > current_value)
        {
            tab[j] = tab[j - 1];
            j--;
        }
        
        tab[j] = current_value;
        i++;
    }
}



key insights here:

	We start with the first element considered "sorted" already

	For each new element, we:

		Save its value
		Shift larger elements rightward to make room
		Place the value in its correct position


Insertion sort mimics the way people often sort cards in their hand - 
you pick up a card and insert it into its proper position in the already-sorted cards you're holding.



# Pattern

can be described as a "growing ordered partition with backward traversal for insertion." This algorithm embodies several computational patterns:

Partition maintenance: The array is conceptually divided into two partitions - sorted (left) and unsorted (right). With each iteration, the boundary moves right, growing the sorted partition.

Backward traversal for insertion: When placing a new element into the sorted partition, we don't scan from beginning to end, but rather from the insertion point backward, which creates a more efficient movement pattern for in-place sorting.

Sliding window with memory: The algorithm maintains knowledge of what's been previously processed (the sorted portion) and uses that to inform future decisions.

Element displacement cascade: When inserting an element, we don't swap pairs of elements (as in bubble sort). Instead, we create a "ripple effect" or cascade, where elements shift right to make room.

Single-pass with nested comparisons: The overall structure has a linear traversal (the outer loop) with a variable-depth nested exploration (the inner loop).



This pattern appears in other algorithms beyond sorting - anywhere we need to maintain an invariant property in one region while processing elements to join that region
