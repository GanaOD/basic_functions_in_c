# my code, calculating result (lcm)

unsigned int	result = (a * b) / hcf;

# problem: int overflow potential


## Mathematical Principles

Distributive Property Application: 
The LCM formula 
LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/HCF(a,b) 
can be rewritten using the distributive property 
as LCM(a,b) = (a/HCF(a,b)) * b

Mathematically these are equivalent, but computationally they have different implications.

Number Theory Insight: 
Since a and HCF(a,b) share common factors by definition, 
a/HCF(a,b) is guaranteed to be an integer. 
This division doesn't lose information but reduces the magnitude before multiplication.

Invariant Preservation: 
The rearrangement preserves the mathematical invariant while changing the computational path.



## Computational Principles

Range Limitation: 
Unsigned integers have a finite range [0, 2^32-1] (for typical 32-bit systems), 
creating a bounded arithmetic system rather than true mathematical integers.

Modular Arithmetic: 
When overflow occurs, the result wraps around according to modular arithmetic 
(mod 2^32), which breaks the intended calculation.

Operation Ordering: 
In computation, the order of operations affects not just readability 
but correctness when dealing with bounded representations.

Risk Mitigation: 
By performing division before multiplication, we're reducing 
the maximum possible intermediate value, 
effectively managing the risk profile of the calculation.

Information Preservation: 
The alternative approach preserves all mathematical information 
while avoiding the computational limitation.




This principle of "divide before multiply" appears in many computational contexts 
where overflow is a concern - 
it's a specific instance of the more general principle of managing intermediate value magnitudes 
in fixed-width arithmetic systems
