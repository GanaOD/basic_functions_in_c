# PROBLEM
(in my original implementation)

if (nbr == 1)
		printf("1"); return ;


# ANALYSIS


C Language Level

	The syntax error relates to C's statement scoping rules where a single statement follows a conditional without braces
	This creates an unintended control flow where the return statement executes unconditionally rather than only when nbr == 1


Systems Programming Level

	This represents a classic control flow bug where execution terminates prematurely
	The function exits before completing its intended computation, demonstrating how subtle indentation issues can lead to significant logical errors
	Memory and stack management work correctly (the function properly returns to caller), but the algorithmic logic is short-circuited


Computational Theory Level

	What we're seeing is an inadvertent transformation of the algorithm from an iterative factorization process to a constant-time function that always returns immediately
	The program structure no longer matches the mathematical problem structure (prime factorization)
	The time complexity effectively changed from O(âˆšn) in the intended implementation to O(1) in the buggy version


Software Engineering Level

	This demonstrates why consistent brace usage is considered a best practice in many coding standards
	It's an example of how visual formatting (indentation) doesn't affect execution but can mislead developers about the actual control flow
	The bug is particularly insidious because the code compiles without warnings
