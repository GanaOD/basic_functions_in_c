# Design

Convert the input string to an integer using atoi
Handle the special case of 1 (which has no prime factors but should output 1)
Find all prime factors by testing division with increasing potential factors


# Prime factor algo

the logic: if a number is divisible by a factor, we divide it and continue testing the same factor until it's no longer divisible. 
Only then do we move to the next potential factor
