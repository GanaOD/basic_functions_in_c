NULL terminators/sentinels represent the concept of "boundary marking" or "termination signaling" in data structures. 
A solution to the problem of "how do we know when something ends?"


Pattern:
	Strings: '\0' (NULL character) marks the end
	Linked lists: NULL pointer marks the end
	Arrays: Size is either:
		Explicitly stored (like array length)
		Or terminated (like NULL-terminated arrays)


higher-level pattern here: "out-of-band signaling":
	using a special value outside the normal data range to convey meta-information about the structure itself


connection to mathematical concepts:
	Set theory: Boundary elements
	Graph theory: Terminal nodes
	Category theory: Terminal objects


pattern emerged historically because computers need explicit ways to represent boundaries that are implicit in human thought. 
When we think of a list or string, we naturally perceive its boundaries, but computers need these boundaries to be explicitly encoded.



UPCOMING:
explore how this pattern manifests in:
	Different data structures
	Assembly level
	Memory management systems
