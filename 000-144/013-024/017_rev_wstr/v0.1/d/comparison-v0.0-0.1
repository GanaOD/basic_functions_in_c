key differences:

Order of operations:

	Your previous version first skips spaces, then identifies a word
	The new version first identifies a word, then skips spaces


Pointer window definition:

	Previous: You set ptr_trail after finding the end of a word
	New: You set ptr_trail at the beginning of the loop and move ptr_lead to find word boundaries


Return condition:

	Previous: Explicit return after processing the first word
	New: Natural loop termination when ptr_lead < str


Space handling:

	Previous: if (ptr_lead > ptr_begin) condition for spaces
	New: if (ptr_lead >= str) condition for spaces



Both approaches work, but the new version is slightly cleaner because:

	The flow is more straightforward - find a word, print it, move to next word
	The pointer window definition is more intuitive
	Loop termination is handled naturally by the loop condition


The thought process difference is subtle but important:

	Previous version: "Skip what I don't want, then find what I want"
	New version: "Find what I want, use it, then skip what I don't want"


The second approach tends to lead to cleaner code because it focuses on the core operations (finding and printing words) rather than the intermediate steps (skipping spaces).

Neither is objectively "better" - they represent different ways of thinking about traversal problems. 
The new version is slightly more elegant in how it handles the flow and boundary conditions.
