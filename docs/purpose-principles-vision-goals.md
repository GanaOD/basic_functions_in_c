# purpose, principles

### broad area, domain
mathematics
logic
computation, computer programming

### purpose of this project (repository)
building foundations, dedicated practice

problem-solving, "learning by doing", "top-down" learning, struggling with new material
	 as staple, core, key part 
	 		of practice/training plan
(see my notes on life, learning...)

this is meant to be difficult, demanding, beyond me, my edge of capability, push me beyond my limits...
raising the fire, pressure

hence name: crucible
	from alchemy:
		represents a vessel of extreme transformation. severe testing, extreme conditions
		where materials are reduced to their essence: breaking down & rebuilding. destillation, purification
		this work is to lead to purification of mind: 
			from 	Moha, ignorance, convolution, mess...
			to   	vision, clarity: knowing archetypes, structure to manifest them

Also due to my higehr-level life vision, goals... (professionally etc.)
	for which I need to learn a lot & get good 
	in a short time


# vision, goals, plan

regular practice

**goals, aims, targets:**
	concrete process: first 2 hours of every day
	new problem daily (!) 
	with regular iteration back through previous work (incremental learning)
		applying new insights, skills, knowledge...
		creating later versions of solutions...

	entry in progress.md ~ weekly

**measuring progress, transformation:**

through systematic conquest of previously insurmountable challenges:

Yesterday's impossible is today's warmup - Fundamental gauge of advancement
Concepts, problems that once appeared opaque become transparent, then intuitive
Solutions that required hours of struggle now flow naturally from first principles

Evidence of transformation:
	Ability to immediately visualize multiple solution paths where before I saw none
	Recognition of elegant patterns in others' code that previously seemed like magic
	Capacity to predict implementation challenges before encountering them
	Growing ability to translate mathematical abstractions directly into working code
