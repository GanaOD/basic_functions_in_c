Organisation: numerical
more or less corresponding to order of first time working on problem


/d			docs
/g			ganaod: my work
/o			other work (person, organisation): alternative implementations 



/d:
	b				brief / subject / specification / description:	problem to solve
	r				synthesis of insights across all versions



/g:
		/v		versions:

				v1			1st run through problem. Solution/implementation that works
					basic functionality, "gets the job done", "good enough"
					not aiming for mathematical elegance, advanced computational abilities
				vx			explore: exploring mathematics, computation
					e.g. alternative, more advanced data structures & algorithms
					experimental: can be creative, can have fun
					maybe aim for greater mathematical purity...
					these can also be numbered for incremental work, e.g. vx1 (a little exploration), vx2 (more advanced...)
				vsec		security-hardened: to study security principles


						within each /v:
							p				plan, design considerations
							s				solve: actual code
							r				reflection: insights, what I learned: brief descriptions of ideas, concepts, theory...
																ideas for future exploration



/o:
	/name/handle:
				s				solve / solution: their code
				a				analysis, incl. insights gained...
