Organisation: numerical
more or less corresponding to order of first time working on problem

LEVEL 1:

/d			docs

the following categorisation does not always exist:
/g			ganaod: my work
/o			other work (person, organisation): alternative implementations 
	this distinction only used if other work included. else: default == my work 
	> straight to next level: v


LEVEL 2:

/d:
	b			brief / subject / specification / description:	problem to solve
	d			see d below: this is for synthesis of insights across all versions (both g/ and o/)



/g:
		/v		versions:

			lower numbers: likely to be basic, simple, sth. that "gets the job done", is "good enough"
										esp. v0: 1st run through problem. Using my mind, current abilities to do my best shot & get something that works. struggling, etc.
										okay if just a quick hack, ok is not elegant
			later iterations:
				explorative, experimental
					exploring mathematics, computation
					e.g. alternative, more advanced data structures & algorithms
			
				experimental: can be creative, can have fun

				possible versions:
					security-hardened: study security principles

			aiming for a version that's mathematically pure, computationally v advanced
				
	

						within each /v:
							s				solve: actual code
							d				documentation:
												plan, design considerations
												reflection: insights, what I learned: brief descriptions of ideas, concepts, theory...
																ideas for future exploration



/o:
	/name/handle:
				s				solve / solution: their code
				a				analysis, incl. insights gained...
